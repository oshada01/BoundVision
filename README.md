The project is currently in the testing and sensor integration phase. We have successfully connected and validated basic functionality for the vibration sensor and LED output using an ESP32 microcontroller. Sensor readings are being captured accurately, and real-time feedback is provided via the onboard LED and Serial Monitor.

Next steps include:

Fine-tuning sensor thresholds for different vibration intensities.

Expanding the code to include data logging or wireless transmission.

Designing a modular architecture for additional sensor types.
